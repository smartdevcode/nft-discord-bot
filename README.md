# Configuration
All configuration is done via environment variables, which are as follows:
| Env Var      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| CONTRACT_ADDRESS      | Ethereum address for the NFT Smart Contract       |
| DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN   | Pretty self explanatory        |
| DISCORD_SALES_CHANNEL_ID   | The discord channel id where sales events should be posted to, should look like a long number       |
| DISCORD_TOKEN_COMMAND | The command word you'd like the bot to respond to for posting token information, pick a simple word that represents the collection, see example above |
| OPEN_SEA_API_KEY | Contact OpenSea to request an API key at https://docs.opensea.io/reference#request-an-api-key.  The bot will work without it, but heavy use may result in being blocked. |
| OPEN_SEA_COLLECTION_NAME | The collection slug name on OpenSea, get this from the browser when you are viewing a collection, e.g. the collection name for https://opensea.io/collection/boredapeyachtclub is "**boredapeyachtclub**"|
